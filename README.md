# Ironhack-mid-bootcamp-project

The objective of this project is to develop a classification machine learning model to predict if a customer would accept a credit card offer from a bank. Besides Jupyter Notebook, other tools were used to help understand the customers caracteristics and behavior: Tableau Public and MySQL Workbench.

Workflow on Jupyter Notebook:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Feature Selection
  - Upsampling
  - Pre-processing
  - Encoding and Scaling Features
  - Modeling
    - Logistic Regression
    - KNN
----------------
The folder "deliverables" contains the Jupyter Notebook used for developing the model, and the SQL queries (.txt and .sql). You can access the Tableau Workbook on [this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/IronhackMidBootcampProject/BankAnalysis-CreditCardAcceptance?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The folder "tasks" contains the SQL and Tableau questions and some other tips.

The folder "files" contains the data used for this project in .csv and .xlsx format.
